RE_PROJECT_SETU, the first project I have done in Assembly 64bit which involves the user inputing a string of text which then gets swapcased. 
After the swapcase has executed, the string will then be put through a ROT47 encryption as the final part of the code. I also added some extra
uniquess to the code to output the strings for both the swap and rot47 to make it clear.
